# Hopfield_Network
 A Hopfield network is a form of recurrent artificial neural network which serve as content-addressable memory systems with binary threshold nodes.
 
 This code implement different stages in the operation of a Hopfield network, i.e. the storage phase (learning) and the retrieval phase (initialization, iteration until
convergence, outputting) to store 3 patterns as an input (which are the images of number 0, 1, 2) and recall the distorted version of these patterns (distort_image.m distort the initial patterns with different level of distortion).
